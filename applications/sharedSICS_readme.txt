This is a model for protein quantification from mass spectrometry proteomics data, written by Alex Phillips. Further information can be found in his (soon to be published) thesis.

The model has an awkwardly-shaped posterior and requires some tuning of parameters (init_r =1.0, stepsize = 0.01) to run smoothly.
