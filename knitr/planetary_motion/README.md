# Bayesian Model of Planetary Motion 


In this case study, we go through multiple attempts at fitting a model.
Some of these attempts take a long time to run.
To make the compilation of the bookdown faster, we generate and save Stan fit objects ahead of time under `saved_fit`.
To recreate the fit objects, you can uncomment the appropriate code in `planetary_motion.rmd`.
